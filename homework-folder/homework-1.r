#' From the response we learned that the sum is 101 not 100 this happened because a lot of times
#' when we are dealing with percentages on table, we round up the number. The result have margin error of 3, which indicates that each of the answer

#' # Problem 2
#' test statistic is asymptotically X^2 distributed. If there's an unusual regularity of asssumptions it is said tne d(y) is to asymptotically X^2 distributed with S - 1 as their degrees of freedom.
#' Hence, it is accrute when the H0 holds true.

#' Drawing histogram

barplot(t(ethnicity_admission), col=c('red', 'green', 'blue'), main='Admission by ethnicity')
legend('topleft', colnames(ethnicity_admission), fill=c('red', 'green', 'blue'))

#' ## Part B
#' Null hypothesis : There is no correlation between ethnicity and admission as the both are independent from each other
#' 
#' Alternative hypothesis : There is a correlation between ethnicity and admission as they both depend on each other to produce an outcome
#' 
#' Making the observed table :
ethnicity_admission
#' Making the expected table :
chisq.test(ethnicity_admission)$expected
chisq.test(ethnicity_admission)

#' From the test we learned that we failed to reject the null hypothesis as the p value is smaller than 0.05. Hence, there is no correlation between ethnicity and admission.
